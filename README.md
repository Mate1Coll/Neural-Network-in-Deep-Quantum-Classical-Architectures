# Neural Networks in Deep Quantum-Classical Architectures

**This work is still in progress.**

This project provides the code required to perform nonlinear tasks with quantum input time series within the framework of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC). More specifically, we simulate a deep neural network structure composed of a sequential connection between a QRC—defined by a spin network with a transverse field and local disorder—and a classical Reservoir Computing system, represented by an Echo State Network (ESN). This setup enables us to reproduce memory tasks that are nonlinear in the quantum input (density matrices composed of qubit states).

## Project Structure

- **source/** — contains the structure and classes of the project.  
- **scripts/** — contains the executable programs.  
- **configs/** — contains YAML files where parameters can be modified to reproduce different types of combinations for analyzing the system’s performance.  
- **plots/** — contains a Jupyter notebook with the plots used in the thesis work.

This project was developed as part of my master’s thesis.
